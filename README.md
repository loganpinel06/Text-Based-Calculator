# Basic Texted Based Calculator
Stemming from my first semester CSC101 class's (The Science of Computing) advanced program 5
This program will allow users to enter basic equations containing +, -, *, /, ^ and follows the rules of PEMDAS without using the built in eval() function.
The program doesn't allow for parenthesis.
Additionally to Python, I also coded this in Golang to practice learning the fundamentals of Go.

What I Learned:
- How to use Python dictionaries
- How to code the orders of operations in Pythob
- How to parse through strings affectively
- The basics of Golang and its syntax
